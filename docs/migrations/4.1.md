# Version 4.1 migration guide
## Session refreshing
It is no longer necessary to call `DDNA.instance().newSession()` as the SDK has added an automatic session refreshing mechanism, which is enabled by default. If you would like to handle the session refreshing manually then you may disable it during the initialisation step.
```java
DDNA.initialise(new DDNA.Configuration(
        this,
        "environmentKey",
        "collectUrl",
        "engageUrl")
        .withSettings(new DDNA.SettingsModifier() {
            @Override
            public void modify(Settings settings) {
                settings.setAutomaticSessionRefresh(false);
            }
        }));
```

Please note that automatic session refreshing will only work on devices using API14+, as such for older devices you will need to handle the refreshing as before. If your application sets 14 as the `minSdkVersion` when you don't need to worry about this.
