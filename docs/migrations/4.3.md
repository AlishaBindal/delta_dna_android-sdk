# Version 4.3 migration guide
## Notifications
### Build script
At the bottom of your application's `build.gradle` file you should add:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

In your application's `dependencies` closure you should add:
```groovy
compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:10.0.+'
```
This is needed to workaround an issue where the Google Services Gradle plugin is unable to pick up the version of Firebase used based on the transitive dependencies.

### Manifest
You can remove the following permission-related entries:
```groovy
<permission
    android:name="com.deltadna.android.sdk.notifications.example.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"
    android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
<uses-permission
    android:name="com.deltadna.android.sdk.notifications.example.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"/>
```

The following receivers can be removed:
* `com.google.android.gms.gcm.GcmReceiver`

The `com.deltadna.android.sdk.notifications.NotificationListenerService` entry should look like:
```xml
<service
    android:name="com.deltadna.android.sdk.notifications.NotificationListenerService">
    
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT"/>
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```

The following `meta-data` entries should no longer be used as most of them will now be configurable through the Platform instead (or by customising the `NotificationListenerService`):
* ddna_sender_id
* ddna_notification_icon (kept for legacy support)
* ddna_notification_title (kept for legacy support)
* ddna_start_launch_intent (kept for legacy support)

The last three will be kept around for legacy support, however they will be completely removed sometime in the future.

### Sender ID
Specifying the Sender ID is no longer going to be possible through the manifest file, but instead the *play-services.json* file should be downloaded from the Google Developer or Firebase Console and placed in the root directory of your application module (for example `app/`).

### Registration
Once the library is included in your project as a dependency it will automatically handle registrations and retries in case of failure, as such there will no longer be the need to call `DDNANotifications.register()`.

### Events
Instead of registering a `BroadcastReceiver` with the `LocalBroadcastManager` and checking for `Intent` actions we have added the [`EventReceiver`](library-notifications/src/main/java/com/deltadna/android/sdk/notifications/EventReceiver.java) class which can be extended and registered in your manifest in order to listen to push notification related events.

### Look and behaviour
In order to change the look and/or behaviour of posted notifications the `NotificationListenerService` should be extended as before, but instead the `createFactory(Context)` method should be overridden to provide a [`NotificationFactory`](library-notifications/src/main/java/com/deltadna/android/sdk/notifications/NotificationFactory.java) implementation providing the needed changes.
