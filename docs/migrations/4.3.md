# Version 4.3 migration guide
## Notifications
### Manifest
You can remove the following permission-related entries:
```groovy
<permission
    android:name="your.package.name.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"
    android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
<uses-permission
    android:name="your.package.name.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"/>
```

The following receivers can be removed:
* `com.google.android.gms.gcm.GcmReceiver`

The `com.deltadna.android.sdk.notifications.NotificationListenerService` entry should look like:
```xml
<service
    android:name="com.deltadna.android.sdk.notifications.NotificationListenerService">
    
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT"/>
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```

#### Application and Sender IDs
With the move to Firebase the Application ID will need to be specified in addition to the already existing Sender ID. If your application needs to be migrated to the Firebase Console then you can find instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/google-android#migrate_your_console_project) on how to do it. Once you've found your Application ID you will need to add it as a `meta-data` entry inside of the `application` section of your manifest file.
```xml
<application ...>
    ...
    
    <meta-data
        android:name="ddna_application_id"
        android:resource="@string/application_id"/>
    <meta-data
        android:name="ddna_sender_id"
        android:resource="@string/sender_id"/>
</application>
```

If using Unity then the Sender ID should be configured through the Unity Editor menu item.

The following `meta-data` entries should no longer be used:
* ddna_start_launch_intent (kept for legacy support, will be removed sometime in the future)

### Events
Instead of registering a `BroadcastReceiver` with the `LocalBroadcastManager` and checking for `Intent` actions we have added the [`EventReceiver`](../../library-notifications/src/main/java/com/deltadna/android/sdk/notifications/EventReceiver.java) class which can be extended and registered in your manifest in order to listen to push notification related events.

### Look and behaviour
In order to change the look and/or behaviour of posted notifications the `NotificationListenerService` should be extended as before, but instead the `createFactory(Context)` method should be overridden to provide a [`NotificationFactory`](../../library-notifications/src/main/java/com/deltadna/android/sdk/notifications/NotificationFactory.java) implementation setting the required behaviour.
